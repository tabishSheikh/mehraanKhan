        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="about-me">Growing up, I never stayed in any one place for too long. Constantly moving around, I met new people and gained lifelong friends and mentors that shaped me into the person that I am today - tackling challenges, solving problems, and growing into the best version of myself. I graduated with 4 academic awards from my 8th Grade year, paving the way for my success in the I.B. program I would took in my beginning years of high-school at Riverside Secondary. Here, I founded the Chess Club and contributed to the school’s culture as Vice President of the Muslim Student Association. Presently, in my junior year of high school at Olentangy Berlin, I am privileged to support the UNICEF club as financial coordinator, and help oversee our HOSA Chapter at the Delaware Area Career Center as it’s Co-Vice President. Today, I study Dental Assisting where I work in a collaborative and professional environment, while I balance my academic courses and love for fitness as well as enjoying what I do outside of school by giving back to the community.</p>
